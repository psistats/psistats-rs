# Psistats Configuration
#
# [settings] and [logging] control global settings.
#
# Reporter plugins are configured inside [[r_plugin]] sections.
# Publisher plugins are configured inside [[p_plugin]] sections.
#
# Every plugin required at least three settings:
# name     - the name of the plugin
# enabled  - Set true to enable the plugin, or false to disable it.
# interval - For reporters, this is the interval that they report.
#            If set to 0 but enabled is true, the plugin will be loaded
#            and could be triggered on demand.
#
# Individual plugins could have additional configuration keys
# prefixed with "config."


#
# Global settings
#
[settings]
# Manually set the name of this machine. If left blank the system's hostname
# will be used.
hostname=""

# Set the logging level. Can be error, warning, info, debug, or trace
loglevel="info"

#
# Reporting Plugins
#

# CPU Reporter
#
# Reports current cpu usage in percentage.
#
# Configuration:
# config.combined - If set to false, then an array will be reported
#                     with usage percent for each core. Otherwise Reports
#                     total cpu usage.

config.combined=true

# Memory Reporter
#
# Reports the current total memory and total memory usage.
#
[[plugin]]
name="memory"
enabled=true
interval=5

# Sensors
#
# Reports the values of all available sensors.
#
# To use this on windows, Open Hardware Monitor must be installed.
# To use this on linux/unix systems, libsensors must be installed.
#
# Configuration:
# config.mapping - An array that maps a sensor identifier to another value
# config.includes - If set, only sensor identifiers in this list will be included.
#                   This list is based on sensor identifiers after they have been
#                   mapped
#
# Example:
#
# config.mapping = [
#   [ "/intelcpu/0/temperature/0", "/cpu/package/temp" ],
#   [ "/coretemp-isa-0000/temp0/temp0_input", "/cpu/package/temp"]
# ]
# config.includes = [
#   "/cpu/package/temp"
# ]
#
# The two sensor identifiers are being mapped to the same identifier name. Useful if sharing a configuration between windows and linux.
